# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. This project is meant to create and validate routes between users and the WTWR app using proper utilization of error configurations. Current technologies being used in this project are Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, ESLint with Airbnb config, Prettier, Nodemon.

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Testing

Testing is done primarily with the Sprint 13 Test Suite through Postman

#### Project Pitch

I have made a video [linked here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lnJhs2-iJsll4-sXf6HhDPiAqkyBCdgU/view?usp=drive_link), where I describe the project and some challenges I faced while building it. I was allowed to film my project pitch without having to film my face.
